# Resume

This is my resume website, it is dynamically generated using JavaScript, JSON data, and jQuery. The reason behind this approach was to allow easy editing both in the immediate future as I continue to add projects, and as a long term solution to continually add my experience to.

There are multiple files associated with this project as listed below:

* `resumeBuilder.js`: contains all JSON data as well as all necessary functions to display that data on index.html.
* `helper.js`: contains all content for dynamically generating HTML content, later invoked in resumeBuilder.js. This file also contains the necessary functions to log click events and interact with the Google Maps API.

Additionally `index.html` and `style.css` are included to display the web content and style it respectively.

## HTML5 Boilerplate

For this project it made the most sense to use HTML5 Boilerplate.
Below are a few key reasons:

* Normalize.css (v3.0.3)
* Additional css style guides
* Modernizer.js (v2.8.3)
* jQuery CDN with local backup (v1.11.3)
* Preconfigured Google Analytics
* Additional misc files

Please refer to [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) for additional information.
